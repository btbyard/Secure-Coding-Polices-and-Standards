# Secure-Coding-Polices-and-Standards
An overview of secure coding in C++ and techniques to help you produce secure code from start to finish. 

Here is a description of all files included: 

1. MOD1.zip -- Code that deals with securtiy issues of overflow and underflow
2. SQLInjection.cpp -- Secure code that shows a way to prevent security breaches of SQL injection
3. Encryption.cpp
   encrypteddatafile.txt
   decrypteddatafile.txt -- These two text files are what is produced by that encryption file which 
                            shows how to encrypt data with XOR encryption
4. test.cpp
   unit testing.docx -- These two files show and demonstrate how you can incorporate Google test as    unit tests that show weather tests pass or fail, and help protect your code. 
   
5. CS 406 Security Policy MOD 6 -- This is a 29 page secuirty policy that goes throught 10 coding 
   standards you can use to help you stay secure in C++. It also lists risks and assesments of 
   secureites and vulnerabilites and automation tools you can use to help. 
   
6. CS405 Project Two Presentation -- This is a powerpoint that review the security policy
   A link of the video is shown here which includes voice automations over the slides.
